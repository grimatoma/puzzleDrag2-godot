## Visual regression harness — scenario × viewport golden-diff suite.
##
## Renders each game surface and compares it to a committed golden under
## tests/visual/__goldens__/<platform>/<scenario>/<viewport>.png (platform = OS.get_name(),
## e.g. "Windows" / "Linux"). This sidesteps the cross-platform pixel divergence (Windows/NVIDIA
## vs Linux/llvmpipe) by tagging goldens per platform.
##
## VIEWPORTS (M11 desktop framing). The game is authored at 720×1280 (logical content size, kept
## as content_scale_size for BOTH viewports so stretch=keep frames it). The suite captures two
## window shapes:
##   • portrait 720×1280 — native; window == content, no bars. Runs for ALL scenarios.
##   • desktop  1280×800 — landscape; window ≠ content, so the portrait content PILLARBOXES
##     centred. Runs for a representative subset (DESKTOP_SCENARIOS) where framing matters.
## The per-viewport golden filename (portrait.png / desktop.png) lets both coexist per scenario.
##
## Modes (per scenario × viewport):
##   • Golden EXISTS for the current platform → tolerant per-pixel diff (channel delta > 12 ⇒
##     differing pixel; FAIL the scenario if differing pixels > 1.0% of total).
##   • Golden MISSING for the current platform → render-smoke: assert the capture is exactly the
##     viewport's window size AND not a uniform/blank frame (real content present). A real check.
##
## Both modes contribute checks to the "N checks, M failure(s)" tally; exit 0 on all-pass.
##
## HEADLESS: Godot's headless display server produces NO rendering (blank frames), so this
## harness SKIPS CLEANLY when DisplayServer.get_name() == "headless" — keeping the existing
## headless CI sweep green. The real diff runs where a renderer exists (the dev's GPU machine
## or xvfb+opengl3 in CI).
##
## Run NON-headless so the GPU actually draws:
##   godot --path godot --script res://tests/run_visual_tests.gd                # diff mode
##   godot --path godot --script res://tests/run_visual_tests.gd -- --update    # refresh goldens
##
## On a real diff FAILURE the capture is written to tests/visual/__captures__/<scenario>-<viewport>.png
## (with the differing-pixel %) so a human can inspect. Goldens are loaded via
## Image.load_from_file(globalize_path(...)) — NOT the resource importer — and tests/visual/
## carries a .gdignore so Godot never imports the PNGs (no .import sidecars).

# ── Tuning ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Logical content size — the base resolution the game is authored at. With stretch=keep this
# is ALWAYS the content_scale_size regardless of the on-screen window shape; the engine then
# letterboxes (portrait window) or pillarboxes (landscape window) the rendered result. Both
# viewports below keep THIS as content_scale_size and only differ in the WINDOW (capture) size.
const CONTENT_SIZE := Vector2i(720, 1280)

# Viewports the suite renders at. Each row: { name, size: Vector2i (the WINDOW size we resize to) }.
#   • portrait 720×1280 — the native authored size; window == content, no bars. Runs for ALL
#     scenarios (full coverage, unchanged).
#   • desktop 1280×800 — a LANDSCAPE desktop window. Window ≠ content, so stretch=keep frames
#     the 720×1280 portrait content centred — the meaningful framing test. Runs for a
#     representative subset (DESKTOP_SCENARIOS below) where framing matters.
#
# CAPTURE-SIZE NOTE. With stretch=keep + content_scale_mode=canvas_items, the root viewport's
# render target (what root.get_texture() yields) is the LARGEST CONTENT_SIZE-aspect rect that
# FITS the window — the engine pillarboxes by leaving the surrounding window area to the OS
# compositor (the bars aren't in the root texture). So the captured frame is:
#   portrait 1280-tall window → 720×1280 (window == fit, no shrink)
#   desktop  800-tall window  → height-bound: 800 × round(720/1280*800) = 450×800 (a fitted 9:16)
# This 9:16 capture IS the desktop-framed content as the player sees it centred in the window —
# correctly scaled, aspect-preserved, no clipping/distortion. _capture_size() computes it so the
# render-smoke size check (and the goldens) key on the real captured dimensions, not the window.
