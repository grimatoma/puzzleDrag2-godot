extends SceneTree
## End-to-end INPUT-SIM harness — proves the input layer works headless by driving
## the LIVE Main scene with REAL InputEvents (not direct method calls). Where the
## other suites poke methods/signals (run_scene_smoke calls board.try_resolve;
## run_tool_board_tests emits cell_tapped), THIS one synthesises the actual pointer
## events the OS would deliver and feeds them through Input.parse_input_event, so a
## regression in the input routing itself (Button hit-testing, Board _unhandled_input
## drag pipeline, viewport dispatch) surfaces here even when every logic suite stays
## green.
##
## Run from the godot/ project root:
##   godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/run_e2e_input.gd
## Exits 0 when every check passes, 1 on any failure — so the CI suite loop gates it.
##
## Same dependency-free harness style as the other run_*.gd runners. NO class_name on
## this script (so the port never needs an --import pass to register it as a global);
## class_name globals (Board, Constants, …) are referenced directly, which is fine
## here because we never need them in a `const` context.
##
## ── What it drives ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
##   1. HUD button click flow — synthesise a left press+release at the "🏠 Town" and
##      "📦 Items" button rect centres via Input.parse_input_event and assert the
##      matching screen opened (main._town_screen / _inventory_screen visible). This
##      exercises input → Viewport GUI dispatch → Button.pressed → Main._open_*.
##   2. Board drag flow — seed a known 3-chain into the live board, then synthesise a
##      real press → motion → motion → release pointer drag across the three adjacent
##      same-key cells and assert a chain RESOLVED (chain_resolved fired, length 3).
##      This exercises input → Board._unhandled_input → _begin/_extend/_finish_drag →
##      _resolve. The grid is seeded so a legal 3-chain is GUARANTEED (the random
##      board makes no such guarantee), keeping the run deterministic.
##
## ── Documented headless caveat ────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Real InputEvent routing is attempted FIRST for both flows. The HUD flow has a
## belt-and-suspenders fallback: if a synthesised click does not open the screen
## within a few frames (some headless builds don't run the full Viewport GUI pick
## pass), we re-feed the SAME press+release through the Button's real `gui_input`
## entry point — still the genuine input path (the event a picked Button would
## receive), NOT a direct call to Main._open_town. Which path fired is reported per
## button so the log is honest about what proved the wiring.
