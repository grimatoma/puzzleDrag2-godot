// Web-export boot smoke for the Godot port.
//
// Closes the "Web export succeeds but is never booted/tested" gap: serves the
// post-export godot/dist/ (via tools/serve-godot-dist.mjs) and boots the
// HTML5/WASM build in headless Chromium. Passing proves the engine actually
// initializes end-to-end — WASM streaming-compiles, the .pck mounts, and the
// main scene's _ready runs to completion (which flips window.__hearthGodotReady
// from the OS.has_feature("web") branch at the end of godot/scenes/Main.gd).
//
// This is ONE focused smoke: boot + canvas + no-crash. It deliberately does NOT
// simulate gameplay — input/economy/board behaviour is covered by the headless
// GDScript suites under godot/tests/.

// Keep the boot deterministic by suppressing the first-launch auto-modals (tutorial /
// story / daily) — the canvas + readiness beacon are what this smoke asserts, not the
// onboarding overlay. Mirrors the Phaser suite's __HEARTH_DISABLE_DIALOGS__; read by
// Main.gd's _dialogs_disabled() at boot. Registered before goto so it runs before _ready.
