# the chain-progress bar, the stockpile chip panel, the tool palette + armed banner, the
# 5-tab bottom nav, and the reward-chip FX — now lives in a `Hud` node Main owns (`_hud`).
# Main stays the orchestrator (board, GameState, routing, screens, audio, input, web
# history). The kept member + method names that external callers (the scene-smoke
# assertion `main._chain_label != null`, `run_tool_board_tests` reading
# `main._tool_palette_box`, and the ~20 capture scripts that call the refreshers + read/
# write `_status_label.text` / `_last_res` / `_last_threshold`) depend on are preserved
# below as thin FORWARDERS into `_hud` (properties for fields, one-line methods for the

## ── Cached overlay registry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
## The ONE place every lazily-built overlay screen/modal is cached. Each `_*_screen`
## / `_*_modal` below is a get-only ACCESSOR that reads its node out of this dict by a
## stable id — there is NO separate per-screen storage, so the cache lives in exactly
## one structure. `_overlay_list()` (ESC/back close), the lazy `if _x == null` guards
## in each `_open_*`, and any future text-scale / typography rebuild all iterate THIS
## dict, so they can never drift out of lockstep: registering an overlay
## (`_overlays["id"] = X.new()`) lands it in the close-list AND the rebuild for free,
## and invalidation is a single loop —
##   for k in _overlays.keys(): if is_instance_valid(_overlays[k]): _overlays[k].queue_free(); _overlays.erase(k)
## which both frees the node and "nulls" the accessor (it reads the now-absent key as
## null, so the lazy guard rebuilds it on next open). Get-only by design: an overlay can
## ONLY be written through this dict, which is exactly what stops a newly-added member
## from quietly becoming a fourth thing that has to be kept in sync.
