extends Node
## The HUD presentation layer, extracted from Main.gd (behaviour-preserving).
## A PLAIN NODE container (NOT a CanvasLayer — nesting CanvasLayers would shift compositing
## and break a visual golden); it holds the same child CanvasLayers the HUD always used (a
## background layer=-1, the main HUD layer=1, the fx layer=2, and the bottom-nav layer).
##
## The BOARD page is the React BoardLayout portrait stack (src/ui/puzzleBoard.tsx), top to
## bottom in FIXED bands: the parchment top-bar of pills → the season bar → the tool HOTBAR
## (a dark rail of owned-tool slots) → the ACTION PANEL → the chain hint → the board →
## the status/orders strip → the 5-tab bottom nav, plus the reward-chip FX.
##
## The ACTION PANEL is the React PuzzleActionPanel port: ONE fixed-height card that swaps
## between three exclusive states by what the player is doing on the board —
##   IDLE  (stockpile chip grid) · CHAIN (live chain readout) · TOOL (inspect/armed detail)
## — see _build_action_panel/_update_action_state. Tapping a hotbar slot INSPECTS the tool
## in the panel; tapping it again (or the panel's ARM/USE button) activates it.
##
## Main owns GameState, the Board, routing, screens, audio, and input; it injects `game` +
## `board` before build() and re-points its HUD call sites at this node. Up-calls (a nav-tab
## tap, a tool slot tap, a disarm) are surfaced as SIGNALS — Main connects them and does the
## routing / tool dispatch exactly as before. Loaded via preload (NO class_name) so the port
## never needs an --import pass to register it (mirrors SeasonBar / every lazy modal).

## A nav tab was tapped. `key` is one of "town"/"inventory"/"craft"/"map"/"folk" (React order).
## Main routes it (close siblings via _switch_primary_view + the opener) then sets the active
## tab back via set_nav_current(key) + _refresh_nav().
signal nav_selected(key: String)
## A tool slot was tapped — Main runs the existing tool dispatch (use_tool) unchanged, then
## refreshes the palette.
signal tool_use_requested(id: String)
## The armed-banner "✖ Disarm" button was pressed — Main leaves targeting + clears the tool.
signal disarm_requested
## The floating ⚙ top-right button was pressed — Main opens the MenuScreen (_open_menu).
signal menu_requested
## The top-left "◀ Leave" back button was pressed (shown only in board mode — see set_board_mode).
## Main routes it: on a live farm run it confirms leaving the session (+ ends it with a summary);
## otherwise it falls back to the town/expedition path.

## under it, and the BOARD fills the whole right column. The compact hotbar rail is
## HIDDEN in landscape (React: [data-area="hotbar"]{display:none}).
##
## Trigger threshold: aspect >= 1.2 (vp.x >= vp.y * 1.2). The project stretches with
## aspect="expand", so the logical viewport HEIGHT is pinned to the 1280 base and only
## the WIDTH grows — a real landscape window (e.g. 1280×720) yields a logical viewport
## ~2275×1280 (aspect ~1.78). 1.2 is a clean margin above square (1.0) so a near-square
## window (a foldable mid-fold, ~1.0–1.1) does NOT thrash between layouts, while every
## genuine landscape device clears it. This mirrors React's `(orientation: landscape) and
