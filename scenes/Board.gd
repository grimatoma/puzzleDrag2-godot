class_name Board
extends Node2D
## The 6x6 drag-chain board: rendering, touch/mouse input, and the
## collect → collapse → refill pipeline. Pure rules live in BoardLogic; this
## class owns the on-screen tile nodes and animates them.
##
## `grid` (ints) is the logic mirror BoardLogic reads. `tiles` (Tile nodes) is
## the authoritative visual layer; after every resolve, `grid` is re-synced
## from `tiles` so drag validation always sees what the player sees.

signal chain_changed(length: int)                               ## live, while dragging
## Fired once a legal chain is collected. The Board reports only WHAT was
## chained (tile type + length); resource/economy accounting lives in GameState.
signal chain_resolved(tile_type: int, length: int)
## M8c — fired when a TAP-target tool is armed and the player taps a board cell while
## the Board is in targeting mode (set_targeting(true)). The Board itself does NOT use
## the tool — it only reports WHICH cell was tapped; Main owns the GameState ref and
## applies the tool (mirrors how chain_resolved keeps the Board decoupled from economy).
signal cell_tapped(cell: Vector2i)
## T25 (harbor in-chain pearl capture) — fired when clear_pearl_on_fish_chain is set and a
## resolved chain CONTAINS the FISH_PEARL tile. Carries the chained cells as Array[{row,col,tile}]
## (the same shape as chain_cells_resolved — tile value BEFORE the chain cleared them) so Main
## can pass the tile keys to GameState.try_capture_pearl (the React rule: chain contains pearl +
## ≥ REQUIRED_FISH_IN_CHAIN other fish tiles). Emitted BEFORE chain_resolved. The Board stays
## decoupled from GameState — it just reports WHAT was chained; Main owns the economy.
signal pearl_chain_resolved(cells: Array)
## T7/T9/T10 (farm hazards) — fired on EVERY resolved chain, carrying the chained CELLS as an
## Array of { row:int, col:int, tile:int } (the tile value BEFORE the chain cleared it). Main uses
## this to detect a RAT chain (clear → coins, no credit), a FIRE chain (extinguish → coins), and a
## deadly_pests chain (Cypress/Beet/Phoenix → cull adjacent rats). Emitted BEFORE chain_resolved so
## Main can decide whether the chain is a hazard-clear (RAT) and SUPPRESS the normal credit. The
## cells are the ORIGINAL drag path (not the rat/rubble-swept removal set), so adjacency is checked
## against exactly what the player chained — mirrors pearl_chain_resolved's contract.
signal chain_cells_resolved(cells: Array)
## A REAL drag attempt (2+ cells) released BELOW the minimum chain — nothing resolves.
## Emitted so the HUD can give "not enough" feedback (buzz + nudge); single taps
## (length 1, the tool-target path) never fire it.
signal chain_rejected(length: int)

# Chain-resolve animation timing. The pipeline CASCADES (pop → settle → refill) the
# way the React/Phaser original does, rather than firing every tween at t=0: the chained
# tiles pop out in a staggered wave, then after FALL_DELAY the survivors collapse and
# fresh tiles fall in. Without the stagger + delay the whole move resolved in one
# ~0.13s blur and read as "no animation" (the reported regression).
const POP_TIME := 0.18      ## per-tile pop-out (scale→0 + spin); ~React 180ms
const POP_STAGGER := 0.025  ## extra delay per successive chained tile → a visible wave
const FALL_DELAY := 0.16    ## collapse/refill hold-off so the pop reads before tiles fall

## Active refill pool (Array[int] of Constants.Tile). Defaults to staples only, so
## a fresh game starts staples-only; Main swaps in GameState.active_tile_pool()
## (staples + each placed spawner's tiles) whenever buildings change.
var tile_pool: Array = Constants.STAPLE_POOL.duplicate()

## Minimum chain length the board demands to RESOLVE a drag. Defaults to the base
## Constants.MIN_CHAIN; an active capstone boss raises it via set_min_chain (the
## boss makes you chain harder — see GameState.boss_min_chain / BossConfig). Only
## the resolve checks (_finish_drag / try_resolve) honour it; the dead-board
## reshuffle checks stay at the base min so a raised bar never reads a normal board
## as "dead".
var min_chain: int = Constants.MIN_CHAIN

## M3h (Town 3 rats): when true, a resolved GRASS chain ALSO clears every RAT tile
## 8-adjacent to the chain (Master Ratcatcher — "grass chains collect rats too").
## Main sets this from GameState.has_master_ratcatcher() after load and on every
## board re-pool. The cleared rats are a side effect: they are NOT counted in the
## chain length nor credited (RAT produces nothing).
var clear_rats_on_grass: bool = false

## M3i (Town 2 mine rubble): when true, a resolved STONE chain ALSO clears every
## RUBBLE tile 8-adjacent to the chain — you mine THROUGH the cave-in clutter. Main
## sets this from GameState.is_in_mine() (true exactly while on an expedition), so it
## needs no building (unlike the Master Ratcatcher's grass sweep — mining-through is
## just how mining works). The cleared rubble is a side effect: NOT counted in the
## chain length nor credited (RUBBLE produces nothing).
var clear_rubble_on_stone: bool = false

## T11 (Town 2 mine hazards): when true (exactly while on a mine expedition — Main sets it from
## GameState.is_in_mine()), the drag path SKIPS hazard-BLOCKED cells (RUBBLE / LAVA) so a chain can
## never be drawn through them — mirrors React's tileBlockedByHazard guard in the drag path
## (src/features/mine/hazards.ts:157). GAS / MYSTERIOUS_ORE are CHAINABLE (chaining is their
## counter), so they are NOT blocked. Off the mine this stays false and the drag path is unchanged.
var block_mine_hazards: bool = false

## A1b (upgradeMap-driven upgrade tiles): an optional provider Main installs so a resolved
## FARM chain spawns UPGRADE TILES of the zone's next tier during the SAME collapse/refill — the
## React core loop (src/GameScene.ts nextUpgradeTile + the pendingUpgrades queue). Called inside
## _resolve as `upgrade_provider.call(tile_type, length) -> {count:int, tile:int}` (the shape
## GameState.upgrade_spawn returns): the Board injects `count` upgrade tiles of `tile` among the
## freshly-spawned TOP refill cells (instead of pool draws). Keeping it a Callable — NOT a
## GameState ref — preserves the Board/economy decoupling (the Board never reads game state; it
## only asks an opaque function WHAT to spawn), exactly as it holds Main-set flags above. Unset
## (the default null Callable) or returning count 0 means a plain pool refill — so the mine/harbor
## (no zone upgradeMap) and any pre-A1b caller behave exactly as before.
var upgrade_provider: Callable = Callable()

## The board band's TOP edge in viewport px — Main sets it from Hud.board_top() (the
## fixed line under the action panel) before each layout_for call. The default is that
## same canonical value so direct layout_for(vp) callers (capture tools, scene-smoke,
## e2e-input tests) get the real game geometry without a Main.
var board_top_px: float = 454.0
## Bottom chrome reserve below the board: the status/orders strip (~76px) + the bottom
## nav (UiKit.NAV_RESERVE). layout_for subtracts it from the tile height budget.
const BOTTOM_RESERVE: float = 76.0 + float(UiKit.NAV_RESERVE)

## A1b — upgrade tiles queued for the CURRENT _resolve's refill: an Array of int tile types, one
## entry per upgrade tile to place among the new top cells. Filled at the top of _resolve from
## upgrade_provider and drained as the refill loop spawns top-row cells; always empty between
## moves. A transient (never saved, never read by drag validation).
var _pending_upgrades: Array = []

## T25 (fish pearl in-chain capture — replaces adjacency rule): when true (exactly while
## on a harbor expedition), FISH_PEARL is JOINABLE into a fish-category chain just like
## MYSTERIOUS_ORE is joinable into a DIRT chain (T23). `_cell_can_extend_chain` treats a
## FISH_PEARL cell as compatible with a fish-anchor chain and vice-versa, so the player can
## drag through the pearl + ≥ REQUIRED_FISH_IN_CHAIN fish tiles in ONE chain. On resolve,
## the chain key reported to Main via chain_resolved is the FISH anchor type (not FISH_PEARL),
## and _chain_cells carries all chained tiles including the FISH_PEARL cell, so
## Main._on_chain_resolved can detect the pearl and call GameState.try_capture_pearl.
## Set by Main from GameState.is_in_harbor() after load and on every board re-pool. Off the
## harbor this stays false and the drag path is byte-identical to any other biome.
var clear_pearl_on_fish_chain: bool = false

## T24 (seasonal boss board modifiers): the live boss modifier_state overlay (the
## BossModifierLogic bag — frozen_columns / rubble / hidden / heat / boost+factor), or {} when no
## boss is active. Main pushes it via set_boss_modifier_state() on boss start, every boss turn tick,
## and on resolve (cleared to {}). The Board reads it through the pure BossModifierLogic statics to:
##   • GATE drags — frozen-column / rubble / hidden cells are unchainable (cell_chainable),
##   • RENDER overlays — frozen columns dimmed, hidden cells face-down, heat cells glowing (drawn
##     by Tile via the per-cell flags pushed in _build_tiles / _refresh_boss_overlays),
##   • REVEAL a hidden cell when it's chained (Main calls reveal on the chained cells).
## Empty {} (no boss) leaves every cell chainable + un-overlaid, so the board is byte-identical
## off a boss — mirrors how block_mine_hazards / clear_rubble_on_stone gate only when set.
var boss_modifier_state: Dictionary = {}

var _dragging := false
var _path: Array[Vector2i] = []        ## dragged cells

## Task C — chain-input GATE. When false the board is INERT: a left-press never starts a drag
## (chains can't be drawn), mirroring React's "town is home" model where the board is only
## playable while a bounded farm RUN is active. Main flips this on (set_active(true)) when a run
## starts / a save restored mid-run is loaded, and off (set_active(false)) on launch with no run,
## on return to town, and on the deep-link board-gate redirect. Defaults to true so a board built
## before Main seeds it (and every existing direct-resolve test path) behaves exactly as before —
## the gate only affects the INPUT path (_unhandled_input), never try_resolve/_resolve.
var active: bool = true

## M8c — TAP-tool targeting mode. While true, a left-button PRESS reports the tapped
## cell via cell_tapped and does NOT start a drag (chains are suppressed); motion +
## release do nothing. Main flips this on (set_targeting(true)) when it arms a
## tap-target tool and off again once the tap fires (or is cancelled). When false the
## input path behaves exactly as before — drags + chains are completely unaffected.
var _targeting := false

## M4a — the orange/gold chain-path overlay. A sibling of the tile nodes (shares
## Board-local space) but drawn ON TOP via a high z_index. Created once in _ready
## and DELIBERATELY preserved across _build_tiles rebuilds (which free only Tiles),
## so its reference survives every collapse/refill.
var _chain_overlay: ChainOverlay

## T8 — live wolf-marker overlay nodes (one per wolf), keyed by cell Vector2i. Wolves are
## OVERLAY entities, NOT grid cells (they don't occupy/collapse a board cell — they roam ON TOP
## eating adjacent birds), so they are drawn as their own Node2D markers over the cell centre,
## freed + rebuilt wholesale whenever the wolf set changes (refresh_wolves). Like the chain
## overlay these are siblings of the Tile nodes and survive _build_tiles (which frees only Tiles).
var _wolf_markers: Array = []   ## Array of _WolfMarker Node2D

## T11 — live mole-marker overlay node (the Giant Mole), or null when no mole. Like the wolf the
## mole is an OVERLAY entity (NOT a grid cell — it roams ON TOP consuming adjacent tiles + hops), so
## it rides as its own Node2D over the cell centre, freed + rebuilt whenever the mole moves
## (refresh_mole). A sibling of the Tile nodes; survives _build_tiles (which frees only Tiles).
var _mole_marker: Node2D = null

## M4a — padding (px) of the field-tinted card drawn behind the tiles by _draw().
const FRAME_PAD := 10.0

## A2 — the current farm season index (0=Spring … 3=Winter), driving the per-season field
## tint of the board card's frame border in _draw(). Main pushes it via set_season() on load
## and whenever a resolved farm chain turns the season. Defaults to Spring so a board built
## before Main seeds it still reads as a calm green field (Spring's field colour).
var _season_idx: int = 0

## A2 — the biome the board card's TOP-edge accent strip is tinted for. An optional provider Main
## installs (mirrors upgrade_provider: a Callable, NOT a GameState ref — the Board never reads game
## state, it only ASKS an opaque function). Called from _draw as `biome_provider.call() -> String`
## ("farm"/"mine"/"harbor"); since it re-reads game.active_biome on every redraw it self-updates as
## the player enters an expedition and returns, with no per-transition push needed (the board
## already redraws on biome flips via setup_new_board). Unset (the default null Callable) leaves the
## strip on the farm green, so capture tools / tests that build a bare Board without Main still draw.
var biome_provider: Callable = Callable()

## Resolve "juice" (the React feel the port lacked): a screen shake whose magnitude scales
## with the chain length, an expanding flash ring + a collect spark burst at the chain head,
## and an upgrade-burst flash when the chain spawns an upgrade tile. All are PURELY visual,
## added as Board children (so they shake with the board), self-freeing, and skipped under
## headless (no renderer) so the logic suites stay byte-identical.

## T8 — a wolf-marker overlay: a dark snout-ringed disk with two ears + a fang glint, drawn over
## the cell a wolf roams. Wolves are NOT grid tiles (they don't collapse), so they ride as their
## own Node2D over the board. A SCARED wolf reads dimmer (it won't eat this turn). Pure _draw (no
## textures) so it is headless-safe; the Board frees + rebuilds these whenever the wolf set changes.
