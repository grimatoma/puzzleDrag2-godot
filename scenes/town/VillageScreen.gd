class_name VillageScreen
extends CanvasLayer
## Town-map rebuild Phase 2 — the Stardew-style top-down VILLAGE view on the Town
## nav route, now fully GAMESTATE-DRIVEN. Ground is painted from the hand-authored
## VillageLayout cell catalog into a TileMapLayer built from
## TownArtConfig.build_tileset(); buildings / landmarks / decor are floor-anchored
## Sprite2Ds under a Y-sorted World node; pan/zoom is a transform on that World
## (no Camera2D), clamped so the village never fully leaves view.
##
## CONTRACT (byte-compatible with the old TownMapScreen, so Main only swapped the
## var type + constructor — see Main._open_townmap):
##   signals  closed / state_changed / board_requested / start_farming_requested
##            / ledger_requested / boons_requested (the last two are LATENT —
##            no on-map button emits them; Main still listens)
##   lifecycle setup(g) / open() / close() / plan_lot_count()
##   _action_buttons static keys: board, close, build_open,
##            zoom_in, zoom_out, recenter. Panel keys are added/removed as panels
##            open/close: "demolish" (built-plot card), "build:<id>" +
##            "picker_close" (build-picker card).
##
## PHASE 2 — REAL state, tap routing, build/demolish:
##   · STAGE + PADS each refresh(): _render_stage derives from the CURRENT tier's
##     plot grant (VillageLayout.stage_for_plot_count(plan_lot_count())) — never
##     cached at build time. On a stage change the decor is RE-placed (cleared
##     first); the pad/grass paint under EVERY catalog plot is repainted each
##     refresh (built → grass, visible-empty → pad, beyond the lot grant →
##     grass), so both stage INCREASES and DECREASES repaint correctly.
##   · BUILDINGS: the first game.buildings.size() visible plots carry building
##     sprites (BuildingConfig.shape_of(id) → TownArtConfig art); the remaining
##     visible plots render as empty pads. ORDINAL placement — GameState has no
##     per-plot model; game.build(id) APPENDS, so a new building renders on the
##     next ordinal empty plot (same model note as the old TownMapScreen).
##   · TAPS: landmark > plot. The FARM landmark emits start_farming_requested;
##     the MINE/FISH landmarks launch their expedition through the SAME GameState
##     guards TownScreen uses (can_enter_mine / can_enter_harbor+town2_complete),
##     then emit state_changed (Main re-pools the board) AND board_requested
##     (Main routes to the live board) — locked, they show a small toast instead.
##     An EMPTY plot opens the build picker; a BUILT plot opens the info/demolish
##     card; bare ground dismisses any open panel.
##   · the 🔨 Build overlay button opens the build picker for the first empty
##     plot (the Phase-1 interim ledger routing is gone).
##   · walking NPCs (Phase 3) live in their OWN y-sorted World child —
##     VillageNpcs.gd owns the A* grid, spawn, FSM and SpriteFrames; this
##     screen only instantiates it, forwards the stage on refresh(), and
##     forwards visibility.
##   · AMBIENCE (Phase 4) is the same shape: VillageAmbience.gd (chimney smoke
##     over built houses + pulsing lamp halos + the stage-reveal pad flash)
##     is another self-contained y-sorted World child fed pure data from
##     _rebuild_buildings. The river WATER animates inside the ground TileSet
##     itself (TownArtConfig.build_tileset's frame-animated water source) —
##     zero per-frame code in this screen.
##
## INPUT GOTCHA (CLAUDE.md): the project enables BOTH emulate_mouse_from_touch
## AND emulate_touch_from_mouse, so one physical drag arrives as a real
## InputEventScreenDrag AND a synthesized InputEventMouseMotion. This handler
## listens to the MOUSE path ONLY (like UiKit.make_vscroll) — never add
## ScreenDrag/ScreenTouch branches here or panning will double-count.
