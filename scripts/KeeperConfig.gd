class_name KeeperConfig
extends RefCounted
## The biome KEEPERS — ported VERBATIM from src/keepers.ts (T31). Each settlement type
## (farm / mine / harbor) has a guardian "made conscious by the founding bargain". Once a
## settlement is built up its keeper appears and the player makes a FINAL, per-settlement
## choice:
##   • Coexist  — the keeper stays, the biome keeps its wild gifts → grants 5 Embers
##   • Drive Out — the keeper withdraws → grants 5 Core Ingots
## The choice sets a `keeper_<type>_<path>` story flag (kingdom-wide, path-gated) and grants
## the path's currency. This config is the source of truth for the encounter dialogue +
## rewards (the GDScript analogue of the React KEEPERS map).
##
## SIMPLIFICATION (per the T31 brief). React's Drive Out launches an opt-in "Keeper Trial"
## mini-game (startKeeperTrial → a special board); the port has no trial mini-game, so the
## faithful outcome is collapsed into a DIRECT choice on the keeper encounter: choosing a path
## immediately sets the path flag + grants the currency (give_keeper_reward). The DIALOGUE
## (intro + per-path pitch) is carried verbatim so the encounter reads identically.
##
## Registered as a `class_name` global (like BossConfig / PortalConfig / WorkerConfig) so its
## const + static helpers are reachable WITHOUT a live autoload — headless tests run before the
## scene tree exists. Stateless: never instantiated.
##
## FEATURE FLAG (same spirit as Constants.FIRE_HAZARD_ENABLED + GameState.fire_hazard_force).
## `enabled` gates the WHOLE keeper ENCOUNTER system: the auto-trigger off a build
## (Main._maybe_trigger_keeper via GameState.keeper_encounter_ready), the `keeper` deeplink / QA open
## (Main._open_keeper), and the currency grant (GameState.give_keeper_reward). Default OFF — keepers
## are DISABLED in the shipped game: no encounter ever fires, the deeplink no-ops, and no Embers/Core
## Ingots are ever granted. Set it to true (here to re-enable, or at runtime in a test / dev path) to
## restore the full encounter system.
##
## SAFE TO TOGGLE: story/act progression does NOT depend on it (StoryEngine.next_beat never gates on
## the act, so the act1_keeper_trial beat simply never fires, and NOTHING consumes the
## home_keeper_resolved flag). The only knock-on: the Boons economy has no currency source while it's
## off (Embers/Core Ingots are granted ONLY by the keeper), so boons stay unpurchasable — the Boons
## screen still opens and shows 0/0. No crash, no soft-lock.
##
## A runtime-settable `static var` (not a const) so the keeper unit tests can force it ON to exercise
## the encounter/grant path (mirroring how the fire-hazard tests set fire_hazard_force), even though
## the shipped default is OFF.
static var enabled: bool = false

## True when the keeper encounter system is enabled (the `enabled` flag above). Single source of
## truth read by GameState.keeper_encounter_ready / give_keeper_reward and Main._open_keeper.
static func is_enabled() -> bool:
	return enabled

## The three keepers, keyed by settlement TYPE ("farm" | "mine" | "harbor"). Each entry, carried
## verbatim from src/keepers.ts:
##   id:                   String  — stable keeper id (deer_spirit / stone_knocker / tidesinger)
##   name:                 String  — display name ("The Deer-Spirit")
##   title:                String  — flavour title ("Keeper of Field & Herd")
##   icon:                 String  — the keeper emoji (🦌 / 🪨 / 🌊)
##   appears_after_buildings: int  — buildings the settlement needs before the keeper appears
##   intro:                Array[String] — encounter intro lines (narration / keeper speech)
##   coexist: { label:String, pitch:Array[String], embers:int }    — Coexist path
##   driveout: { label:String, pitch:Array[String], core_ingots:int } — Drive Out path
