## Town-1 (Farm) tier ladder — the Camp→City rank progression every town climbs.
## Mirrors the locked "Direction" spec table: a single town-center upgrade that
## costs escalating local resources and (a) raises a storage cap, (b) adds
## building plots, (c) unlocks the next batch of buildings (description-only for
## now — the actual building system lands in a later milestone).
##
## Direction spec table (authoritative):
##   Tier  Name     Cap  Plots  Unlocks
##   1     Camp     200  5      Farm board (staple tiles), Orders, the Market
##   2     Hamlet   300  10     Lumber Camp (trees → plank), Granary, first Worker
##   3     Village  400  15     Coop (birds → eggs), Garden (veg → soup), Mill & Bakery
##   4     Town     500  20     Workshop + farm tools, more workers, Caravan Post
##   5     City     600  25     Top farm buildings; the expedition → Town 2
##
## PLOTS (2026-06-10, owner directive — STAGED GROWTH): the town starts SMALL — ~5
## plots at Camp — and physically GROWS a few times on the village map as it tiers
## up (5/10/15/20/25). This supersedes the earlier same-day "starts roomy at 25"
## directive: each tier now lands exactly on the next VillageLayout growth stage
## (stage_for_plot_count: 5→1, 10→2, 15→3, 20→4, 25→5), so a tier-up visibly
## expands the village (new pads, new decor band) instead of just densifying it.
## SAVE OVERFLOW: a pre-re-tune save may hold more buildings than the new grant;
## GameState.can_build blocks NEW builds and VillageScreen still renders every
## built building (its _visible_plots extends past the grant, pads stay capped).
##
## Tier-up COSTS are PC2-aligned FIRST-PASS values — escalating and pulling in
## cross-category goods, all expressed in resources the port can already produce
## (Farm tiles), so the ladder is playable today. They are tunable: edit TIERS.
##
## GATING RATIONALE (M3b). Once the board refill pool is building-gated, a tier-up
## cost may only reference resources producible AT or BELOW the prior tier — any
## category tile requires its spawner, and a spawner only unlocks AT a tier. The
## M3a costs deadlocked here: reaching Hamlet needed `plank`, but plank needs the
## Lumber Camp, which only unlocks AT Hamlet. The revised ladder breaks the cycle:
##   → Hamlet  : staples only (hay_bundle + flour)            — payable at Camp
##   → Village : adds plank (Lumber Camp unlocked at Hamlet)
##   → Town    : adds eggs + soup (Coop + Garden at Village)
##   → City    : more of the same
##
## Registered as a `class_name` global (like Constants) so its consts/helpers are
## reachable WITHOUT a live autoload — headless tests run before the scene tree.
