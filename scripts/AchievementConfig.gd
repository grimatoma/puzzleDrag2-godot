class_name AchievementConfig
extends RefCounted
## Achievement CATALOG (M10 logic core) — the ported, port-reachable subset of the
## Phaser achievements (src/features/achievements/data.ts). Pure data + pure
## helpers; the counter-bump / unlock / reward logic lives in GameState
## (bump_counter) wired into the existing event sites (credit_chain / fill_order /
## build / damage_boss). NO UI — this is a headless-testable data layer mirroring
## BuildingConfig / BossConfig / ToolConfig.
##
## PORTING NOTES (what we KEPT, REMAPPED, and OMITTED vs React data.ts)
##   The Godot port is the farm + mine + one-boss slice. An achievement is only
##   included if the EVENT that drives its counter can actually fire in the port —
##   no fakes, no unreachable trophies. Every omission is listed at the bottom.
##
##   COUNTERS we wire (and where they bump in GameState):
##     chains_committed            credit_chain  (every resolved chain → +1)
##     orders_fulfilled           fill_order    (every successful fill → +1)
##     bosses_defeated            damage_boss   (only on a DEFEAT → +1)
##     distinct_buildings_built   build         (distinct id → +1, first time only)
##     distinct_resources_chained credit_chain  (distinct produced resource → +1)
##     <category>_chained         credit_chain  (Constants.category_of(tile) → +chain_len)
##     mine_chained               credit_chain  (stone/iron/coal/gold/gem categories → +chain_len)
##
##   PER-COUNTER BUMP SEMANTICS (matches React data.ts intent):
##     - "complete N chains"  → counts CHAINS, bump by 1   (chains_committed)
##     - "fill N orders"      → counts ORDERS, bump by 1   (orders_fulfilled)
##     - "defeat N bosses"    → counts BOSSES, bump by 1   (bosses_defeated)
##     - distinct counters    → bump by 1, ONLY on a newly-seen key (handled in GameState)
##     - "harvest N <things>" → counts TILES, bump by chain_len  (every <category>_chained
##       + mine_chained — React "Harvest 50 fish / Pull 50 stone" count tiles, so the
##       Godot category/quantity counters bump by the chain length, not by 1).
##
##   REWARD REMAP (no fake tools). React grants `magic_wand` / `magic_seed`, which do
##   NOT exist in the Godot ToolConfig set (bomb/rake/sickle/auger/blast_charge/axe/
##   scythe/stone_hammer/drill/magnet). Rather than invent a tool, the two React
##   tool-reward tiers grant a REAL port tool — the Bomb — via the M8b grant_tool path.
##   Coin rewards are carried over verbatim.
##
##   OMITTED (genuinely unreachable in the port):
##     - supply_chain (convert 10 grain → supplies): there is no "supplies_converted"
##       event site — supplies are produced by the Kitchen RecipeConfig output, not a
##       distinct counter the port tracks → omitted.
##     - powerful_keep / ability_artisan (building/ability triggers): the port has no
##       unified abilities pipeline / ability-trigger event → omitted.
##
##   RE-ADDED (the older "omitted" reasons were STALE — these ARE reachable in the port):
##     - first_catch / tide_runner / master_angler (fish_chained): the port HAS a working
##       harbor / fish biome; fish_chained bumps at credit_chain via counter_for_category.
##       master_angler grants magic_wand (a real ToolConfig member, summonable elsewhere).
##     - fowler (bird_chained): the port has a "birds" category (pheasant/turkey/…);
##       bird_chained bumps at credit_chain.
##     - champion (defeat 4 bosses): the port ships 6 re-challengeable seasonal bosses (T24),
##       so bosses_defeated is no longer capped at 1 → threshold-4 is reachable.

# ── Reward tool used for the two ex-magic-wand/magic-seed tiers ────────────────
## The real port tool granted where React granted magic_wand / magic_seed (which
## don't exist here). Bomb is a known ToolConfig id, so grant_tool accepts it.
const REWARD_TOOL: String = "bomb"

## The ported, port-reachable achievement catalog. Each entry:
##   id:        String     — stable id (matches React where the achievement survives)
##   name:      String     — display name
##   desc:      String     — one-line player-facing description
##   counter:   String     — the GameState counter that drives it
##   threshold: int        — counter value at which it unlocks (crossing, not >=-poll)
##   reward:    Dictionary — {"coins": N} or {"tools": {id: n}} granted ON unlock
