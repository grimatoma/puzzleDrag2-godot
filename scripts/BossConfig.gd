extends RefCounted
## Seasonal-boss catalog — the GDScript port of src/features/bosses/data.ts. The boss is no
## longer a single HP-attrition Frostmaw fight; it is a TIMED RESOURCE-TARGET challenge: each
## of the SIX bosses asks for a target quantity of a specific resource/tile within a fixed
## window (BOSS_WINDOW_TURNS turns), under a board MODIFIER that complicates the gather. Beat
## the target before the window expires to win the reward (coins scaled by the year + the
## overshoot margin, plus a Rune). The CAPSTONE boss (storm) still gates Town 2: defeating it
## marks town2_complete, which a later milestone consumes to unlock Town 3.
##
## CATALOG (carried VERBATIM from data.ts BOSSES — ids / names / seasons / targets / modifiers /
## descriptions):
##   id            season  target                       modifier
##   frostmaw      winter  tile_tree_oak ×30            freeze_columns {n:2}
##   quagmire      spring  tile_grass_grass ×50         respawn_boost {boost:[oak,grass], factor:1.5}
##   ember_drake   summer  iron_bar ×3                  heat_tiles {spawnPerTurn:1, burnAfter:2}
##   old_stoneface autumn  tile_mine_stone ×20          rubble_blocks {count:4}
##   mossback      spring  tile_fruit_blackberry ×30    hide_resources {hidden:4}
##   storm         summer  fish_fillet ×6               min_chain {length:4}
##
## REWARD (bossReward, data.ts:88-96): defeated when progress >= target; on a win
##   base    = 200 * year
##   margin  = min(1.0, (progress - target) / target)
##   bonus   = floor(base * margin * 0.5)
##   coins   = base + bonus ; runes = 1
## A loss (window expired before the target) yields nothing.
##
## WINDOW: BOSS_WINDOW_TURNS = 10 (one season — data.ts:98). Each boss turn decrements the
## remaining window; resolve when the target is met OR the window expires.
##
## CAPSTONE: `storm` is the capstone (the dramatic Town-2 close). The whole 6-boss rotation is
## reachable (the challenge spawns the CURRENT farm-season's boss; see GameState.start_boss),
## and defeating the capstone sets town2_complete (preserving the old M3g progression gate).
##
## Registered as a `class_name` global so its consts + static helpers are reachable WITHOUT a
## live autoload — headless tests run before the scene tree exists. Stateless: never instantiated.

## The capstone boss id — defeating it sets town2_complete (the Town-2 → Town-3 gate). Kept as a
## named const so the gate reads `id == BossConfig.CAPSTONE` rather than a bare literal.

## How many turns a boss challenge runs (one season). Ported from BOSS_WINDOW_TURNS (data.ts:98).
const BOSS_WINDOW_TURNS: int = 10

## Mine-mastery UNLOCK gate (a Godot-port challenge prerequisite, alongside the City tier and an
## in-season boss): the player must have banked at least MINE_MASTERY_THRESHOLD combined units of
## the refined mine goods named in MINE_MASTERY_GOODS (block + iron_bar). Owned by BossConfig so the
## threshold + goods list live in ONE place — both can_challenge_boss and start_boss read this helper
## rather than duplicating the literal `qty("block") + qty("iron_bar") < 12` comparison.

const MINE_MASTERY_GOODS: Array = ["block", "iron_bar"]

## True when the banked refined-mine goods MEET the mine-mastery gate (combined >= threshold).
## `block_qty` / `iron_qty` are the player's current quantities of the two MINE_MASTERY_GOODS, in
## that order. The boss gates invert this (gate FAILS when NOT met) — keeping the exact same
## `< MINE_MASTERY_THRESHOLD` comparison they used inline.

## Boss catalog keyed by id. Each entry:
##   name:                 String     — display name
##   season:               String     — the farm season this boss belongs to ("winter"/"spring"/…)
##   target:               Dictionary — { "resource": String, "amount": int, "label": String }
##                                       `label` is the short HUD-pill label for the target
##                                       resource/tile (e.g. "Oak"/"Hay"/"Iron"); read via
##                                       target_label(). The owning attribute for a boss target's
##                                       short name lives on the target here, not in the HUD.
