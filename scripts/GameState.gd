extends RefCounted
## The single owner of run economy: collected resources, fractional chain
## progress (carry-over), coins, and a turn counter. Ported from the Phaser
## reducer's resourceProgress accumulator (src/state.ts CHAIN_COLLECTED site +
## src/utils.ts upgradeCountForChain).
##
## ACCUMULATOR SEMANTICS (authoritative React source). Per resolved chain of
## tile-type `t`, length `n`:
##   resource     = Constants.produced_resource(t)
##   threshold    = Constants.threshold_for(t)          (NO_THRESHOLD-safe)
##   new_progress = progress[resource] + n
##   units        = new_progress / threshold            (int division → floor)
##   progress[resource] = new_progress % threshold      (remainder CARRIES OVER)
## The carry-over across chains is the whole point: a chain of 4 grass
## (threshold 6) yields 0 units but leaves progress 4; a later chain of 4 grass
## makes progress 8 → 1 unit, progress 2.

# ── NPC roster + bonding (ADDITIVE — ported from src/features/npcs) ────────────
## The 5-NPC roster and per-NPC bond (a float in [0, 10]) now live in a composed
## NpcState (the same pattern as `settlement` / `story`). Every order is REQUESTED by
## an NPC (generate_order picks one via the seeded `rng`); filling it pays a
## bond-ADJUSTED reward (NpcConfig.reward_with_bond) and raises that NPC's bond by
## BOND_GAIN_PER_FILL. The default bond is 5.0 (Warm, ×1.00), so a fresh order's payout
## is IDENTICAL to the pre-bonding flat reward until a bond crosses into Liked (≥7) or
## Sour (<5) — keeping this layer additive. Persisted as the flat top-level "npcs" key
## (see to_dict / from_dict), byte-identical to before the extraction.
var npcs_state := NpcState.new()
## Bond gained each time an order from that NPC is filled (+0.3). Forwarded from

# ── Expedition / biome (M3f, the Town-2 mine) ─────────────────────────────────
## SIMPLIFICATION (M3f): a SINGLE SHARED inventory. The locked Direction makes
## resources per-settlement, but for this milestone mine goods (block/iron_bar/
## coke/dirt/cut_gem) land in the SAME `inventory` as farm goods, and there is no
## separate Town-2 tier ladder. The per-settlement resource split + a full Town-2
## settlement are deferred to a later milestone. (Mine HAZARDS — cave-ins/gas/
## moles — are also out of scope here; they arrive with the boss milestone.)
##
## The expedition is "the combination" from the Direction: the farm makes food,
## the Kitchen packs food into `supplies`, and supplies are spent as MINE TURNS on
## an expedition into the mine biome. Mine runs are SOFT-FAIL — when the turns run
## out the run ends and everything gathered is kept (it's already in `inventory`).
var active_biome: String = "farm"   ## "farm" | "mine" | "harbor" — which biome the board shows
var mine_turns_left: int = 0        ## remaining mine turns this expedition (0 on the farm)

# ── T26: Cartography travel state (ported from src/features/cartography/slice.ts) ──
## The 11-node world-map travel state machine. `map_current` is the node the player is "at"
## (default "home"); `map_node_state` maps every visited/discovered node id → its state string
## ("visited" | "discovered"); a node absent from the dict is HIDDEN. Mirrors React's
## mapCurrent + mapVisited/mapDiscovered (slice.ts:13-20), collapsed into one {id → state} dict
## (hidden = not present, so the dict only holds discovered ∪ visited).
##
## Discovery rules (slice.ts:43-110): home starts VISITED, its neighbours DISCOVERED. You may
## FIRST-travel only to a node adjacent to a VISITED node, meeting its level + paying its coin
## entry cost; arriving marks it visited and discovers its neighbours. You may FAST-travel to
## any already-VISITED node from anywhere (no adjacency / level / cost). travel_to() is the
## single mutation entry; it routes BOARD nodes (farm/mine/fish) into the matching expedition
## board so the world map is the real way to start a run. NON-board nodes (event/festival/boss/
## capital) are handled by Main on the {ok:true, kind} result — travel_to only moves the marker.
##
## ADDITIVE GUARANTEE: a save written before the travel state existed loads with the default seed
## (home visited, neighbours discovered) via the from_dict defensive default; SAVE_VERSION is NOT
## bumped. The default seed is applied in _ready of GameState (init below) so a bare new() is also
## seeded — see _seed_map_state.
var map_current: String = "home"
## node id (String) → "visited" | "discovered". A node not present is hidden. Seeded by
## _seed_map_state() in _init so a bare GameState is always navigable.
var map_node_state: Dictionary = {}

# ── T22: Multi-settlement founding + per-zone state (ACTIVE-ZONE-VIEW + ARCHIVE model) ──
## The locked Direction keys inventory / progress / buildings / settlement PER founded zone, with
## a founder flow, and three Hearth-Tokens (one per completed settlement TYPE) that unlock the Old
## Capital finale. Porting React's nested-map shape (inventory[zoneId], built[zoneId], …) would
## break the hundreds of FLAT `inventory[res]` / `qty()` / `buildings` accesses across this whole
## codebase. Instead this is an ACTIVE-ZONE-VIEW + ARCHIVE model:
##   • The flat `inventory` / `progress` / `buildings` / `settlement` / `farm_turns_used` fields
##     are the LIVE view of the CURRENTLY-ACTIVE zone (`map_current`, default "home").
##   • `zone_archives` holds the SNAPSHOTTED state of every NON-active founded zone.
##   • `_activate_zone(id)` snapshots the live fields into zone_archives[old], then loads
##     zone_archives[id] (or fresh defaults) into the live fields + sets map_current.
## A fresh game never leaves home, so the live fields behave EXACTLY as before — every existing
## suite stays byte-identical. Founding / archives / tokens are purely ADDITIVE.
##
## coins / tools / workers / runes / npcs / achievements / story / quests / almanac / boons /
## embers / core_ingots / market / heirlooms stay GLOBAL (NOT per-zone) — mirroring React's
## src/state/zoneInventory.ts ("coins, tools, workers, level, knowledge stay global").

## Per-founded-zone founding record: { zone_id:String -> { founded:bool, biome:String,
## keeper_path:String } }. Home is IMPLICITLY founded (is_settlement_founded special-cases it),
## so a fresh game's map is EMPTY — exactly like React's state.settlements (home never recorded).
var settlements: Dictionary = {}

## Snapshotted state of every NON-active founded zone: { zone_id:String -> { inventory, progress,
## buildings, settlement (tier dict), farm_turns_used } }. The ACTIVE zone's state lives in the
## live flat fields, NOT here. Empty for a home-only game (home is the active zone, never archived).
var zone_archives: Dictionary = {}

## The Hearth-Tokens held (GLOBAL): { token_id:String -> 1 } where token_id is one of
## CartographyConfig.HEARTH_TOKEN_FOR_TYPE values (heirloomSeed / pactIron / tidesingerPearl).
## A completed settlement of a type grants its token ONCE; holding all three opens the Old Capital.
## React state.heirlooms (data.ts:541-554 grantEarnedHearthTokens). Empty for a fresh game.
var heirlooms: Dictionary = {}

# ── Farm season cycle (A1, ported from src/features/zones + src/constants SEASONS) ──
## The home farm is a PERSISTENT board that cycles four seasons (Spring→Summer→Autumn→
## Winter) over a turn budget, then HARVESTS and wraps back to Spring. `farm_turns_used` is
## the spent-turn counter WITHIN the current season cycle (0..budget); the budget itself is
## ZoneConfig.base_turns(_active_farm_zone()) — the live farm board follows the ACTIVE farm node,
## defaulting to home for a home-only game. The SEASON is derived
## from these via Constants.season_index — see current_season_index / current_season_name
## below. This is a SEPARATE counter from `turn` (the monotonic story/quest counter above) —
## do NOT conflate them. note_farm_turn() ticks this after each FARM chain (parallel to
## note_mine_turn / note_harbor_turn for the expeditions), advancing the season and harvesting
## at the budget boundary (reset to Spring).
##
## ADDITIVE GUARANTEE: a save written before seasons existed loads farm_turns_used = 0 (the
## from_dict defensive default) — a fresh Spring cycle. SAVE_VERSION is NOT bumped.
var farm_turns_used: int = 0        ## spent farm turns within the current season cycle (0..budget)

# ── Bounded farm RUN (Task A, ported from React FARM/ENTER + CLOSE_SEASON) ─────
## React's "Start Farming" lifecycle: you pay an entry cost from town, play a BOUNDED
## number of turns (the per-run, fertilizer-aware budget), then the run ENDS and you
## return to town with a season-end bonus (close_season). This is the bounded analogue
## of the always-on, infinitely-wrapping season cycle above.
##
## ADDITIVE GUARANTEE: a bare GameState.new() has farm_run_active = false, so
## farm_turn_budget() falls back to the ACTIVE farm node's base_turns via _active_farm_zone()
## (home → 10 for a home-only game) and note_farm_turn() keeps its legacy infinite-wrap
## behaviour. Every existing suite that
## never starts a run is byte-identical. The six fields restore defensively in from_dict;
## SAVE_VERSION is bumped by a SEPARATE later task (this is the logic foundation only).
var farm_run_active: bool = false       ## a bounded run is in progress
var farm_run_budget: int = 0            ## this run's total turn budget (fertilizer-aware)

# ── T30: Run TELEMETRY (the rich run-summary recap, ported from src/features/runSummary) ────────
## The per-run accumulator the rich HarvestModal dashboard reads. RESET at start_farm_run (a fresh
## run), ACCUMULATED during the run (credit_chain ticks chains/longest/best-moment/resources/coins/
## upgrades; enter_mine/enter_harbor record supplies consumed; post_story_event records fired beats;
## a bond snapshot at run-start backs the bond-delta), and SNAPSHOTTED at close_season (build_run_summary
## packs the live fields + the bond deltas into the dashboard dict). Mirrors the React RunSummary
## fields (slice.ts): chainsPlayed, biggestChain {count,key,coinGain,upgrades,gained}, totalUpgrades,
## totalCoinGain, resourcesGained, bondsAtStart/bondDeltas, beatsTriggered, suppliesConsumed,
## fertilizerUsed.
##
## TRANSIENT — like pending_tool / fill_bias, this is NOT persisted (to_dict/from_dict skip it): a
## run summary only matters between start_farm_run and the run-end modal, and a reload mid-run simply
## starts the recap fresh. SAVE_VERSION is NOT bumped. A bare GameState.new() has farm_run_active ==
## false so nothing accumulates; every existing suite is byte-identical.

# ── Fish / Harbor expedition (M3j, ported from src/features/fish) ──────────────
## The harbor is the THIRD biome, MIRRORING the mine expedition (M3f) and SHARING the
## same single inventory (the catch — fish_fillet/sea_shells/pearls/fish_oil — lands in
## `inventory` alongside farm + mine goods). Like the mine it is SOFT-FAIL: when the
## harbor turns run out the run ends and everything caught is kept. Two harbor-only
## mechanics ported from React (src/features/fish):
##   1. TIDE CYCLE — the tide is "high" or "low" and flips every Constants.TIDE_PERIOD
##      spent harbor turns. The tide drives which fish surface on the board's bottom row
##      (HIGH_TIDE_POOL / LOW_TIDE_POOL); the live bottom-row mutation is the next (board)
##      slice's job — this layer just owns the tide state + flip bookkeeping.
##   2. GIANT PEARL — one rune-capture pearl per harbor session (the analogue of the
##      mine's Mysterious Ore). It carries a Constants.PEARL_TURNS countdown; chaining it
##      with >= Constants.REQUIRED_FISH_IN_CHAIN other fish tiles before it expires grants
##      +1 Rune (try_capture_pearl). The board slice places it on a live cell; for the
##      LOGIC slice we just record its turns_left (and a deterministic seed cell).
##
## ADDITIVE GUARANTEE: none of this runs unless active_biome == "harbor". On the farm /
## in the mine every harbor field sits at its default and every harbor method is a no-op
## or guarded out, so farm + mine behaviour is byte-identical (existing suites stay green).
var harbor_turns_left: int = 0      ## remaining harbor turns this expedition (0 off the harbor)
var fish_tide: String = "high"      ## "high" | "low" — the current tide on the harbor board
var fish_tide_turn: int = 0         ## spent harbor turns under the current tide (flips at TIDE_PERIOD)
## The live giant pearl, or {} when none is active. Shape: { row:int, col:int,

## turns_left is the capture countdown ticked by note_harbor_turn.

# ── Seasonal bosses (T24, the Town-2 close) — TIMED RESOURCE-TARGET model ──────
## REWRITTEN from the single HP-attrition Frostmaw fight to React's 6 seasonal bosses as
## TIMED RESOURCE-TARGET challenges (src/features/bosses/data.ts + modifiers.ts + boss/slice.ts).
## A boss asks for a target quantity of a resource/tile within BOSS_WINDOW_TURNS turns under a
## board MODIFIER; meet the target before the window expires to win (coins scaled by year +
## overshoot margin, +1 Rune). The CAPSTONE boss (storm) still gates Town 2: beating it sets
## town2_complete, which a later milestone consumes to unlock Town 3. See BossConfig +
## BossModifierLogic for the catalog + the pure modifier rules.
##
## All 6 bosses are REACHABLE: a challenge spawns the CURRENT farm-season's boss (start_boss),
## and `town2_complete` only blocks RE-challenging the capstone — the other five can be fought
## any number of times (each season's boss is encounterable). The reward `year` is tracked per
## instance (defaults to 1 — the port has no calendar; see boss_year below).
##
## boss_active replaces the old boss_active/boss_hp pair. The richer per-fight state lives in the
## BossInstance fields below; boss_active just names the live boss ("" when idle). town2_complete
## is unchanged (the Town-2 gate). The board MODIFIER overlay lives in boss_modifier_state, the
## GDScript analogue of React's boss.modifierState (rendered/gated by Board, ticked by Main).
var boss_active: String = ""              ## "" when no challenge in progress, else a boss id

# ── Town 3 rats hazard (M3h) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
## SIMPLIFICATION (M3h, consistent with the M3f single-shared-inventory note): per
## the Direction, Town 3 is its own settlement with the rats lesson. For this
## milestone "Town 3" is just the EXISTING farm board gaining the rats hazard once
## town2_complete — a separate Town-3 settlement + the per-settlement resource split
## remain deferred to a later milestone. Rats become active the moment the capstone
## boss is defeated (rats_enabled), seeding Constants.RAT_POOL_SLOTS rat tiles into
## the farm pool. RAT produces nothing, so chaining rats wastes a move — that's the
## hazard. The Ratcatcher (free "shoo" moves) and Master Ratcatcher (grass chains
## also clear adjacent rats) are the Town-3 answer (BuildingConfig hazard buildings).
## The "5 free moves/year" from the Direction maps to BuildingConfig.RATCATCHER_CHARGES (there
## is no year/season calendar in the port — see the turn-counter note above — so the charges
## are a flat per-run budget the player spends down). The CONST now lives on BuildingConfig
## (with the building it belongs to); only the spent-count below is run STATE.

# ── Farm HAZARDS live state (T7/T8/T9, ported from src/features/farm) ───────────

# ── Mine HAZARDS live state (T11, ported from src/features/mine/hazards.ts) ──────

# ── Magic Portal (ADDITIVE — ported from src/features/portal) ───────────────────
## Whether the Magic Portal town building has been built. The Portal is the gate that
## unlocks SUMMONING magic tools (summon_magic_tool): it must be built before any summon
## succeeds, mirroring React's `built.portal === true` check in the portal slice (the
## React flag is set by building the Magic Portal town building at src/constants.ts:805,
## cost 2000 coins + 5 runes — see build_portal below). Starts false.
##
## ARCHITECTURE NOTE: the Godot BuildingConfig is a narrow spawner/refiner/hazard catalog
## with INVENTORY-paid costs; the Portal costs coins + RUNES (non-inventory currencies) and
## does not fit that model, so it is NOT a BuildingConfig entry. Instead this flag + the
## build_portal coins/runes gate live directly on GameState, faithfully mirroring React's
## special-cased portal gate (src/state.ts:808 "Special gate: portal requires runes").
##
## Persisted defensively in to_dict / from_dict (a save written before the portal existed
## loads with portal_built = false). SAVE_VERSION is NOT bumped — like every prior additive
## field.
var portal_built: bool = false

# ── Quests + Almanac (ADDITIVE — ported from src/features/quests + almanac) ──────

## quests rolled (an empty `quests`) every tick site is a no-op loop over [], so the
## economy is byte-identical to the pre-quests build and every existing suite stays
## green. Quests are only rolled when ensure_quests() / reroll_quests() is called (the
## UI / Main does this) — a bare GameState.new() carries an empty quest list.
##
## The seed string mirrors React's `${saveSeed}|${year}|${season}` — the port has no
## calendar, so `quest_day` folds year+season into one monotonic int and `quest_seed`
## is the stable per-save seed (default a fixed string so rolls are deterministic +
## headless-testable; a real save could randomise it once at creation, but a fixed
## default keeps determinism contracts simple). reroll_quests() bumps quest_day and

## Board.clear_rubble_on_stone sweeping rubble 8-adjacent to a STONE chain): a same-key
## fish chain run NEXT TO the pearl captures it. The Board only emits its `pearl_chain_resolved`
## signal for a FISH-category chain of length >= REQUIRED_FISH_IN_CHAIN (it owns the grid +
## tile types), so the fish-category + length gates are enforced there; this method enforces
## the harbor / live-pearl / adjacency gates against GameState. try_capture_pearl stays as

## flower/herd/cattle/mount are NOT eligible, so PANSY/PIG/COW/HORSE never base-spawn here.

## Construction (DETERMINISTIC, no RNG — the RNG lives in BoardLogic.refill which samples this
## pool): for each eligible category with a POSITIVE season weight, add round(weight*100) slots
## of that category's tile (floored at 1 so any positive weight contributes at least one slot).
## Spring (grass .38 …) yields a grass-dominant pool; Winter (trees .73) a tree-dominant one.

## DESIGN NOTE: Do NOT change the `var coins: int = 0` field default — the test
