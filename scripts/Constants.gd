class_name Constants
extends RefCounted
## Game constants — mirrors the relevant slice of src/constants.ts (PC2 baseline).
##
## M1 scope: board dimensions, the Farm starting tile set, upgrade thresholds,
## and Stage-1 placeholder colors. Registered as a `class_name` global so its
## consts / enums / static helpers are reachable WITHOUT a live autoload — this
## matters for headless tests, which run before the scene tree exists.
##
## Source references are to the Phaser codebase this is ported from; see
## docs/godot-migration-plan.html (strategy) and
## docs/godot-migration-progress.html (status).

# ── Board dimensions (src/constants.ts:151-153) ────────────────────────────
const COLS: int = 6
const ROWS: int = 6
const TILE_SIZE: int = 74          ## base tile size in px (responsive at runtime)
const MIN_CHAIN: int = 3           ## default minimum chain length (a boss may raise it)

## Coins a brand-new game starts with (React src/state/init.ts:71 — `coins: 150`).
## Seeded by GameState.new_game() so the entry-cost gate (start_farm_run costs 50) is
## immediately affordable. The `var coins: int = 0` field default is intentionally left at
## 0 — only new_game() applies this baseline (the test suites build GameState.new() at 0).
const STARTING_COINS: int = 150

## Per-chain coin economy — M2 PLACEHOLDER. The React per-tile `value` coin economy is
## deferred to M3; until then each resolved chain earns floor(chain_len / divisor) coins,
## floored to at least the minimum. Kept as named consts so the formula reads by name and the
## integer-division semantics stay byte-identical (do NOT switch to per-item value — that's M3).
## Used by GameState.credit_chain: maxi(CHAIN_COIN_MIN, chain_len / CHAIN_COIN_DIVISOR) + bonuses.
const CHAIN_COIN_MIN: int = 1
const CHAIN_COIN_DIVISOR: int = 2

## Sentinel for an empty grid cell.
const EMPTY: int = -1

## The most slots the Start-Farming picker ever shows (the home zone has <= 8). Named here (Batch 9
## D7) instead of a modal-local const so the picker cap is a shared, drift-resistant value. Mirrors
## the React MAX_SLOTS.
const MAX_FARM_SLOTS: int = 8

## The most resource-tally chips the run-end HarvestModal shows (top N by quantity). Named here
## (Batch 9 D9) instead of an inline `8` so the cap reads by name. Mirrors React's ResourceTally
## "top 8 shown".
const HARVEST_TALLY_MAX: int = 8

## The starter tool rack granted ONCE on a fresh game (Main._ready, only when game.tools.is_empty()).
## A small visible set so the puzzle page reads as a populated TOOLS rack from the first run, using
## REAL ToolConfig ids: Scythe×2 (instant — clears 6 random tiles), Bomb×1 (tap-target 3×3 blast),
## Rake×1 (tap-target — sweeps a connected same-type patch). Ordered { "id", "count" } rows so the
## grant order is data, not three inline calls. The honest equivalent of the React fresh-game grant
## (Scythe×2 + Seedpack + Lockbox); the port has no seedpack/lockbox so it grants the wired tools.
const STARTER_TOOLS: Array = [
	{ "id": "scythe", "count": 2 },   # instant (clears 6 random tiles) — proves instant path
	{ "id": "bomb", "count": 1 },     # tap-target (3x3 area blast) — proves targeting mode
	{ "id": "rake", "count": 1 },     # tap-target (clears a connected same-type patch)
]

# ── Tile types — Farm biome starting set (src/constants.ts FARM pool) ───────
## GDScript enums are int-backed. STRING_KEYS maps each value back to the
## canonical Phaser tile key, used for save serialisation and (asset-pipeline
## Stage 2) PNG filename lookup: res://assets/tiles/<key>.png.

	# ── Rats hazard (M3h, Town 3) — APPENDED (ordinal 15) so every farm/mine
	# ordinal above is unchanged (GRASS==0 … HORSE==9, STONE==10 … GEM==14). RAT is
	# a board-only HAZARD tile: it produces NOTHING (chaining rats wastes a move) and
	# only seeds into the FARM pool once Town 2 is complete (GameState.rats_enabled).
	RAT,
	# ── Rubble mine hazard (M3i, Town 2 expedition) — APPENDED (ordinal 16) so every
	# farm/mine/rat ordinal above is unchanged (GRASS==0 … RAT==15). RUBBLE is the
	# mine's cave-in clutter: a board-only HAZARD tile that produces NOTHING (chaining
	# rubble wastes a precious mine turn) and only seeds into the MINE pool while on an
	# expedition (GameState.active_biome_pool). You clear it by MINING THROUGH it — a
	# resolved STONE chain clears every rubble 8-adjacent to it (Board.clear_rubble_on_stone),
	# the built-in mine analogue of the Master Ratcatcher's grass→rats sweep.
	RUBBLE,
	# ── Fish / Harbor biome (M3j, Town 3 expedition — ported from src/features/fish) —
	# APPENDED (ordinals 17..22) so every farm/mine/rat/rubble ordinal above is unchanged
	# (GRASS==0 … RUBBLE==16; saves use STRING_KEYS, so appending is the safe way to add
	# tiles). These tiles only enter the board during a HARBOR expedition (the fish biome —
	# GameState.active_biome_pool). The harbor mirrors the mine expedition: the farm packs
	# food into supplies, supplies are spent as HARBOR TURNS, and the catch lands in the
	# SAME shared inventory. The board has a TIDE cycle (high↔low every TIDE_PERIOD turns)
	# that the next (board) slice uses to mutate the bottom row from HIGH_TIDE_POOL /
	# LOW_TIDE_POOL.
	FISH_SARDINE,
	FISH_MACKEREL,

	FISH_OYSTER,
	FISH_KELP,
	# FISH_PEARL (the "giant pearl") is the harbor's rune-capture tile — the analogue of
	# the mine's Mysterious Ore. It produces NOTHING on its own (deliberately ABSENT from
	# PRODUCES/THRESHOLDS, so produced_resource is "" and threshold_for returns the
	# NO_THRESHOLD sentinel, exactly like RAT/RUBBLE). It is captured by chaining it with
	# >= REQUIRED_FISH_IN_CHAIN other fish-category tiles before its PEARL_TURNS countdown
	# expires → +1 Rune (GameState.try_capture_pearl). Its own "fish_pearl" category keeps
	# it out of the fish-spawn pools (it is conditionally seeded by the board slice, not
	# weighted into FISH_POOL / the tide pools).
	FISH_PEARL,
	# ── Full tile-catalog parity (all 77 web tiles) — APPENDED (ordinals 23..78) so every
	# existing farm/mine/hazard/fish ordinal above is UNCHANGED (GRASS==0 … FISH_PEARL==22;
	# saves serialise via STRING_KEYS, so appending is the safe way to grow the catalog).
	# These are CATALOG-ONLY variants: each shares its family's threshold + produced resource
	# and only differs in art (res://assets/tiles/<key>.png). They appear in the Tile Collection
	# screen (the full 77-tile catalog) but are NOT seeded into any board refill pool here — the

	COIN_GOLDEN,
	# ── Fire farm hazard (T7, ported from src/features/farm/hazards.ts) — APPENDED so every
	# existing ordinal above is UNCHANGED (saves serialise via STRING_KEYS). FIRE is a board-only
	# HAZARD tile (like RAT/RUBBLE): it produces NOTHING (deliberately ABSENT from PRODUCES/
	# THRESHOLDS → produced_resource "" + threshold_for NO_THRESHOLD). Fire SPREADS to an
	# adjacent free cell each turn (HazardLogic.tick_fire) and is cleared by chaining FIRE tiles
	# (HazardLogic.try_extinguish_fire → +2 coins/tile). GATED OFF by default to match the live
	# React game (FIRE_HAZARD_ENABLED false; isFireHazardEnabled() reads a tuning override).
	FIRE,
	# ── Mine hazards (T11, ported from src/features/mine/hazards.ts) — APPENDED so every existing
	# ordinal above is UNCHANGED (saves serialise via STRING_KEYS). Three new board-only HAZARD/special
	# tiles for the Town-2 mine expedition:
	#   LAVA  — the Lava Flow hazard cell (MineHazardLogic.tick_mine_hazards spreads it to one random
	#           orthogonal free cell each turn). BLOCKS chaining (MineHazardLogic.tile_blocked_by_hazard,
	#           like RUBBLE) and produces NOTHING (deliberately ABSENT from PRODUCES/THRESHOLDS →
	#           produced_resource "" + threshold_for NO_THRESHOLD). Cleared by the Water Pump tool
	#           (turns lava → rubble). React key "lava" (hazards.ts:240 `key: "lava"`).
	#   GAS   — the Gas Vent cloud cell. UNLIKE lava/rubble it is CHAINABLE (chaining through gas is
	#           the counter — disperse_gas), so it is NOT in tile_blocked_by_hazard. Produces NOTHING.
	#           A 3-turn countdown lives on GameState.mine_hazards.gas_vent; chaining the gas cell before
	#           it expires disperses the vent, else it costs a turn on expiry. React models gas as a
	#           per-cell `gas` overlay flag; the port models it as a single board GAS tile at the vent
	#           cell (documented adaptation — the port has no per-cell overlay-flag layer).
	#   MYSTERIOUS_ORE — the rune-capture tile (the mine's analogue of the harbor's FISH_PEARL). It is
	#           CHAINABLE and produces NOTHING via the normal chain path (ABSENT from PRODUCES/THRESHOLDS);
	#           a 5-turn countdown lives on GameState.mysterious_ore. Chaining it together with >= 2 DIRT
	#           tiles before it expires grants +1 Rune (MineHazardLogic.is_mysterious_chain_valid); on
	#           countdown expiry it degrades to plain DIRT (tile_special_dirt). React key "mysterious_ore"
	#           (mysterious_ore.ts:58).
