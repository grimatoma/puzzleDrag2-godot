# puzzleDrag2 — Godot 4 port

The Godot 4.6 version of the game, built side-by-side with the React+Phaser
version at the repo root. Strategy: [`docs/godot-migration-plan.html`](../docs/godot-migration-plan.html).
Live status & decisions: [`docs/godot-migration-progress.html`](../docs/godot-migration-progress.html).

## Live build (GitHub Pages)

The Web export is deployed alongside the Phaser game at **`/puzzleDrag2/godot/`**
(e.g. `https://<user>.github.io/puzzleDrag2/godot/`). The Pages workflow
([`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)) exports the
"Web" preset into `dist/godot/` after the Vite build, on every push to `main`.
The export is nothreads, so it runs on plain Pages with no special headers.

## Layout

```
godot/
  project.godot          # Godot 4.6 project, GL Compatibility renderer, portrait
  export_presets.cfg     # "Web" preset (nothreads → works on GitHub Pages)
  icon.svg
  scripts/
    Constants.gd         # board dims, Farm tile set, thresholds, placeholder colors
    BoardLogic.gd        # pure rules: chain validation, collapse, refill, dead-board
  assets/
    tiles/               # v1 tile PNGs exported from Phaser (asset pipeline §2)
      <key>.png          # one per board tile, named by canonical item key
      v2/<key>.tres      # v2 animated SpriteFrames (asset pipeline §3, drop-in)
  scenes/
    Tile.gd              # one tile: v2 SpriteFrames → v1 PNG → placeholder (3-tier)
    Board.gd             # 6x6 grid: render + drag input + collect/collapse/refill
    Main.gd / Main.tscn  # root scene: Board + HUD (chain counter, resource tally)
  tests/
    run_tests.gd         # headless unit tests for BoardLogic (exit 0/1)
    run_assets_tests.gd  # headless asset-pipeline tests (v1/v2/fallback, exit 0/1)
    run_scene_smoke.gd   # headless Main+Board wiring smoke (exit 0/1)
  tools/
    screenshot.gd        # render Main to a PNG (evidence / visual checks)
    demo_capture.gd      # capture a highlighted chain + post-resolve board
    make_v2_grass.gd     # generate the v2 grass SpriteFrames fixture (asset §3)
```

`Constants` and `BoardLogic` are registered via `class_name`, so their consts,
enums, and static helpers are reachable in headless tests without a live tree.

## Run

```bash
# Open the editor (local dev)
godot --path godot --editor

# Play the game (windowed)
godot --path godot

# Import once (builds .godot/ cache + global class registry)
godot --headless --path godot --import

# Unit tests (pure board logic)
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/run_tests.gd

# Scene wiring smoke test
godot --headless --path godot --script res://tests/run_scene_smoke.gd

# Web export (needs export templates for 4.6.2 installed)
godot --headless --path godot --export-release "Web" dist/index.html
```

On Windows the binary used during development is
`Godot_v4.6.2-stable_win64_console.exe` (console variant prints to stdout).

## Web navigation (Back/Forward + deep links)

On the **Web export only**, the browser's Back/Forward buttons (and mobile
swipe-back) drive the screen/menu nav. Opening a screen pushes a `#/<id>` entry
onto the browser history; closing it (or pressing Back) pops back to the board.
The wiring lives in `scenes/Main.gd` (`_setup_browser_history` / `_sync_history`
/ `_on_browser_popstate`) and is a complete no-op on desktop/headless. It mirrors
`_router.current_modal()` (the `ViewRouter` nav state) onto `location.hash`, so:

- **Deep links** — loading `…/godot/#/inventory` (or `#/town`, `#/map`,
  `#/cartography`, …) opens that screen on launch. Ids are the canonical strings
  from `ViewRouter.modal_id()`; aliases (`items`, `folk`, `world`, …) also resolve.
  Unknown/empty hashes fall back to the board.
- **Back/Forward** — each open is a history entry, so Back closes the current
  screen and Forward reopens it, exactly like the in-game ✕.

Pure id/hash parsing (`ViewRouter.id_from_hash`) is unit-tested in
`tests/run_router_tests.gd`; the live browser round-trip is covered by the web
smoke `tests/godot-web/back-forward.spec.ts` (`npm run test:godot-web`).

## Asset pipeline

Tiles render through three stages (newest available wins), so each is a clean
drop-in over the last — full plan: [`docs/godot-migration-plan.html` §assets](../docs/godot-migration-plan.html).
`scenes/Tile.gd` resolves, per tile key (`Constants.STRING_KEYS`):

1. **v2** `res://assets/tiles/v2/<key>.tres` — an animated `SpriteFrames`,
   rendered via `AnimatedSprite2D` (`idle`, looping).
2. **v1** `res://assets/tiles/<key>.png` — a flat exported Phaser texture.
3. **placeholder** — `Constants.color_for()`, a procedural colored square, so a
   tile with no committed asset still renders.

**Regenerating the v1 PNGs** (run once; re-run only if a Phaser texture changes).
This drives the live Phaser app and extracts every board-tile texture from its
runtime cache — they are procedural Canvas drawings, not files on disk:

```bash
npm run dev                      # from the repo root — start the Vite dev server
node tools/export-v1-tiles.mjs   # writes godot/assets/tiles/<key>.png (+ manifest.json)
godot --headless --path godot --import   # import the new PNGs
```

**v2 fixture.** `godot/assets/tiles/v2/tile_grass_grass.tres` is a
pipeline-validation fixture (a real animated sway, generated by
`tools/make_v2_grass.gd`) that exercises the Stage-3 path; `run_assets_tests.gd`
covers it. Production v2 art arrives per-tile from the external PixelLab/Ludo.ai
feed (M4+) — drop a `v2/<key>.tres` in and the tile animates with no code change.

CI runs the two test scripts and the Web export on every push that touches
`godot/**` — see [`.github/workflows/godot-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/godot-ci.yml).
